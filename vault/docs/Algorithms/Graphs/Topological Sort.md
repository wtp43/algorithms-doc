# Topological Sort
- Sort the graph in an ord/er such that no vertex appears before another vertex that has an edge to it.
- The ordering does not have to be unique

## Topological Sort Using DFS
- Post-Order Traversal

Â **Run DFS on an entire graph and add each node to the global ordering of nodes, but only after all of a node's children are visited**. This ensures that parent nodes will be ordered before their child nodes, and honors the forward direction of edges in the ordering. 

- Orders the vertices on a line such that all directed edges go from left to right
- Such an ordering cannot exist if the graph contains a directed cycle
- Each [[Graph Theory#Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)|DAG]] has at least one topological sort, they are not unique

>[!Purpose]
>Gives an ordering where each vertex can be processed before it's successors. This allows us to seek the shortest/longest path from x to y in a DAG

# DFS Implementation

```python
def topsort(self,graph):
	seen = set([])
	ordering = deque()
	for node in graph.get_vertices():
		self.dfs_topsort(node, seen, ordering)
	return ordering

def dfs_topsort(self, graph, node, seen, ordering):
	if node in seen:
		return 
	seen.add(node)
	for neighbor in graph.get_neighbors(node):
		self.dfs_topsort(neighbor, seen, ordering)
	ordering.appendleft(node)
```

## Modified to detect cycles

```python
def topsort(self,graph):
	vis = defaultdict(lambda: 0)
	ordering = deque()
	for node in graph.get_vertices():
		self.dfs_topsort(graph, node, vis, ordering)
	return ordering

def dfs_topsort(self, graph, node, vis, ordering):
	if vis[node] == 2:
		return 
	if vis[node] == 1:
		raise CycleError
	vis[node] = 1
	for nbor in graph.get_neighbors(node):
		self.dfs_topsort(graph, nbor, vis, ordering)
	ordering.appendleft(node)
	vis[node] = 2
```

- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Space Complexity: O(depth)

## Kahn's Topological Sort Algorithm
Find vertices with no incoming edges and removing all outgoing edges from these vertices.

Maintain in-degree information of all graph vertices.
Removing an edge from u to v will decrement ``indegree[u]`` by 1.

If a cycle exists, then not all vertices will be able to achieve an indegree of 0. If the top_order does not have a length of n, then we must have encountered a cycle.

```python
def topsort(edges, n):
	top_order = deque()
	indegree = [0] * n
	adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n)]
	for u,v in edges:
		adj_list[u].append(v)
		indegree[v] += 1

	# Store all the nodes with no incoming edges
	q = deque([i for i in range(n) if indegree[i] == 0])
	while q:
		# extract front of queue
		u = q.popleft()
		# add the current vertex to the tail of the ordering
		top_order.append(u)
		for v in adj_list[u]:
			indegree[v] -= 1
			if indegree[v] == 0:
				q.append(v)
				
	if len(top_order) != n:
		print('Cycle Exists')
	return top_order

```
## Applications
> Use topological sort when there is a dependency on the edges

            in_degrees[v-1] += 1
            graph[u-1].append(v-1)

        @lru_cache(None)
        def dfs(mask, in_degrees):
            if not mask:
                return 0
            # nodes that can be taken (if bit is 1)
            nodes = [i for i in range(n) if mask & 1 << i and in_degrees[i] == 0]
            ans = math.inf
            # Check all combinations with size k
            for k_nodes in combinations(nodes, min(k, len(nodes))):
                new_mask, new_in_degrees = mask, list(in_degrees)
                # set bit for all nodes in combination
                for node in k_nodes:
                    new_mask ^= 1 << node
                    for child in graph[node]:
                        new_in_degrees[child] -= 1
                # recurse
                ans = min(ans, 1+dfs(new_mask, tuple(new_in_degrees)))
            return ans
        return dfs((1<<n)-1, tuple(in_degrees))
```

#### Parallel Courses II

- Without the requirement `k`, this would be a topological problem
- Why do we need DP? There is no optimal subproblem on which course should be taken first.

### [All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/)
- To guarantee sorted order of ancestors (without sorting the answer), iterate in sorted order
- Skip the next node if it has already been visited before
```python
def getAncestors(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:          
	graph = [[]for _ in range(n)]
	for u,v in edges:
		graph[u].append(v)
	ans = [[]for _ in range(n)]

	def dfs(u, par):
		for v in graph[u]:
			if ans[v] and ans[v][-1] == par:
				continue
			ans[v].append(par)
			dfs(v,par)     

	for u in range(n):
		dfs(u,u)

	return ans
```
