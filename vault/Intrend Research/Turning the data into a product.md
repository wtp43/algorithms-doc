## What data/analysis can we sell?

### labeled images
- Give to trend analysis companies to use themselves

### Brand's performance
- directly to brands
- difficult to determine for brands with low presence 
- difficult to sell to big brand, but would be very useful 
### Clothing Trends
to overseas factories, patterns in overall acceptability of certain items

### Color analysis

### LLM Dataset

### Influencer Lists
- comprehensive list of influencers/celebrities and their brand
- filterable based on 
- style, 
- audience, 
- type of posts
- types of items they use (this may be tricky legally..?)
- companies can get a list of influencers to contact that better fits their needs
	- companies want influencers that fit their product's image
- currently, only vague or restricted lists based on writer's style and knowledge 


##  Other Fields (outside fashion)
Email Lists:
There are legitimate email list provider companies (e.g., Cognism, Lusha),

â†’ i think it's illegal to sell personal emails/non-business emails without consent according to laws like Canada anti-spam legislation
- publicly available personal emails may be gray area
