## Timeless items/trends
- resistant to becoming trends, but do not go obsolete
	- even though they can grow in popularity, they probably have relatively stable popularity
	- not distinct enough to dominate an outfit, becomes the background or can be styled in may outfits without feeling like the same
- Factors:
	- practical utility (as opposed to social)
		- function (e.g.,)
		- durability (e.g., *denim*) *denim can be very trendy, it just doesn't go obsolete after it's done*
		- practicality (.e.g., sneakers)
		- versatility (in situations/styling) (e.g., white tee)
- if need be, it may be possible to make this list manually 

## Dealing with Style Trends
- a lot of items trend not just because of the item itself but because it falls within a bigger "style" trend. 
- E.g., logos are a part of street style, logos phasing out can also predict that street style is also starting to phase out
- difficult to understand, sometimes the bigger style trend is keeping the item alive 
## Dealing with Seasons
### Potential solution 1
- Separate data into 4 seasons 
- Main: Summer/Winter, Transition: Spring, Fall
- then combine 1 main with transitions weighed lighter;
	- e.g., with summer, stitch fall to spring, spring's phasing in compensates for fall's phasing out
- ! Different geographic locations *may* present an issue 
	- (e.g., Australia has opposite seasons)


There are some items that come up with every seasons and *are* trends...
e.g., Burgundy sort of trends every autumn?
but we could check this with machine learning, it may be a multi-year trend
