Potentially filter out: model-type brand ambassadors 
-  usually high-fashion, not in real-life use; not easily adoptable by majority
- e.g., @hoooooyeony ![[Pasted image 20241010214051.png|300]]

Potentially filter in: geographic tags in description (e.g., LA)
- only need major cities 
- needs to be combined with high following so as not to include plebs

Filter in: # of search results with user's @
- helps to filter out bots

Filter in: high freq. posters
- more frequency → more influence
- pot. metrics:
	- num. of posts/account age
	- num. of posts within the last year

Other:  
- num. of stories on profile?
- num of tagged photos on profile 
-

Fashion consumers/instagrammers can be categorized as:

1. Trend-setters/innovators: first to adopt style elements-before these elements are even seen as fashion trends. Soon after they appear in fashion shows → can we get the list of trend-setters using machine learning based on which accounts have a history of adopting trends early? (Are we going to need to exclude fashion designers’ accounts?)
    - e.g., kyliejenner, (of course all credit goes to their stylist, who likely has close connections with designers)
2. High-profile celebrities/influencers (>1m?), follow trend-setters, very early to adopt style elements, also before these elements are seen as fashion trends by the majority. Together, they AND the trend-setters solidify those style elements’ status as fashion trends.
    - Trend-setters and innovators probably have similar follower counts and trend-setters will need to be listed manually based on insider information.
3. Early majority (1m-600k?)
4. Late majority (<600k)
5. Laggards
