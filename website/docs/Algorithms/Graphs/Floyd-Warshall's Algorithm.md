# Floyd Warshall's Algorithm
Dynamic Programming
# Implementation

```python
def floyd(G):
    dis = [[math.inf] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i, j, w in edges:
            dis[i][j] = dis[j][i] = w
        for i in range(n):
            dis[i][i] = 0
        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    dis[i][j] = min(dis[i][j], dis[i][k] + dis[k][j])

```
